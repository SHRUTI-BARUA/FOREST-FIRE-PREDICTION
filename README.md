# 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction - FireGuard AI (Team Project)

This is a **Team Project** aimed at predicting forest fire risks using a hybrid Machine Learning approach. It features a robust web application for monitoring and early detection.

⚙️ Key Features

✅ **Real-Time ML Prediction**: Integrated Flask-based ML service using a pre-trained model.
✅ **Hybrid Data Sources**: Fetches live weather (OpenWeather), NDVI (AgroMonitoring), and Terrain (Open-Elevation) data.
✅ **Odisha Focused**: Specifically optimized for the geographical and climatic conditions of Odisha.
✅ **Risk Classification**: Classifies fire risk into LOW, MODERATE, and HIGH categories with real-time probability scores.
✅ **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based login, signup, and session management.
✅ **Database Integration**: Saves history and predictions to MongoDB for logged-in users.
✅ **Responsive Dashboard**: Beautifully designed UI with real-time feedback and notifications.

📊 Dataset & Model

🔹 **Made from Absolute Scratch**: The dataset used for this project was custom-built by our team. We gathered raw data from satellite imagery, climate records, and historical fire incidents to create a unique, high-quality feature set.
🔹 **Feature Engineering**: Includes Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, NDVI (Vegetation Index), Slope, Aspect, and custom features like **veg_dryness** and **LST_C**.
🔹 **Advanced Logic**: Incorporates **Monotonic Logic** to boost risk assessment based on extreme environmental conditions.
